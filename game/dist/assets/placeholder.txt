This is a placeholder file. 

In a real implementation, this directory would contain:
- 3D models (.glb, .gltf)
- Textures (.jpg, .png)
- Sound effects (.mp3, .wav)
- Other game assets

When integrating the actual Jackalopes game, you would copy the assets from the original project to this directory.
